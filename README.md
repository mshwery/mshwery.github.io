You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deployment

Commits to `main` are automatically built, tested, and deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

You can manually deploy as well by using `yarn deploy` which uses `gh-pages` to deploy from local files.
