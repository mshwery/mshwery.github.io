I've been meaning to mess around with [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/), Facebook's javascript library for building user interfaces. Actually, I was prompted by my 3 open Chrome tabs on React and some twitter chatter.

React is the first of its kind to do something completely unique when it handles rendering updates to the DOM. There are many [frameworks](http://angularjs.org/) and [libraries](http://knockoutjs.com/) devoted to doing this exact thing, with more or less other stuff going on to round out MV* architectures.
