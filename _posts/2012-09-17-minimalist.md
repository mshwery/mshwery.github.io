At last! I launched my simple list app, [minimaList](http://getminimalist.com). In early 2012, I started developing minimaList for my wife and I. We wanted a simple way to share lists without the hassle or formality of user accounts. I had been itching to get familiar with Backbone.js and exercise Rails skills. Today I launched the app. So go, make some lists!
